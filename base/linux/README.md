### Take Screenshot

Quickly take a screenshot of the desktop, a window, or an area at any time using these global
keyboard shortcuts:

- `Prt Scrn` to take a screenshot of the desktop.
- `Alt+Prt Scrn` to take a screenshot of a window.
- `Shift+Prt Scrn` to take a screenshot of an area you select.

When you use a keyboard shortcut, the image is automatically saved in your Pictures folder in your
home folder with a file name that begins with Screenshot and includes the date and time it was
taken.

You can also hold down `Ctrl` with any of the above shortcuts to copy the screenshot image to the
clipboard instead of saving it.

### Record Screen

You can make a video recording of what is happening on your screen:

1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R` to start recording what is on your screen. A red circle is displayed in
   the top right corner of the screen when the recording is in progress.
2. Once you have finished, press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R` again to stop the recording.
3. The video is automatically saved in your Videos folder in your home folder, with a file name that
   starts with Screencast and includes the date and time it was taken.
