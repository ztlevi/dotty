## ZSH ENV

1. ZSH load env via this order: `zshenv -> zprofile -> zshrc`. And it will inject
   `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:`
   into your system PATH at the beginning of zprofile (or the end of zshenv).
2. System PATH changes should go to profile.
3. Host specific config see `shell/work/README.md` (pre-load.zsh and post-load.zsh).
