# shell/asciinema

To start recording run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
asciinema rec
```

When you're ready to finish just exit the shell (either by typing exit or hitting <C-d>).

If you have already recorded an asciicast but you don't see it here then associate it with your
account by running `asciinema auth` in your terminal.
